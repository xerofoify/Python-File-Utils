# License
The License for the program is MIT due to the issues with open source libraries and having to share 
code back under ones like the GPL. Due to your project being based around the library, there are 
still legal issues with giving back your great sauce code that is reloving around my library. MIT
has no issues with that according to my knownledge currently
